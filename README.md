# IMPAQTS-PID

**IMPAQTS-PID** is a curated dataset and accompanying codebase designed to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand and explain implicit content, namely implicatures and presuppositions, in real-world use.

IMPAQTS-PID is a dataset extracted from IMPAQTS, a corpus Italian political discourse annotate for implicit content. [IMPAQTS: a multimodal corpus of parliamentary and other political speeches in Italy (1946-2023), annotated with implicit strategies](https://aclanthology.org/2024.parlaclarin-1.15/) (Cominetti et al., ParlaCLARIN 2024)

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **They want to pretend not to understand: The Limits of Current LLMs in Interpreting Implicit Content of Political Discourse**

## Data

Check the [data](https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID/tree/main/data) directory for the dataset description and usage.

It includes:

- **`IMPAQTS-PID.txt`**:  
  A dataset of 31,822 annotated passages from Italian political speeches. Each instance includes an expert-validated explanation of implicit content (implicature or presupposition).

- **`CoT_prompt.txt`**:  
  The Chain-of-Thought prompt used in our experiments, as described in the accompanying paper.

- **`fs_examples.txt`**:  
  A small curated set of examples for use in few-shot prompting within the open-ended generation (OEG) task.

## MCG_task script

`MCG_task.py` is **already heavily commented inline**; here what we give is a *birdâ€™sâ€‘eye* companion that walks readers through the key functions that drive them.

This script does the following:

1. **Loads** the *IMPAQTSâ€‘PID* dataset.
2. **Prompts** a set of Large Language Models (LLMs) to do a MCG task where they have to pick one out of four possible options (A,B,C or D).
3. **Cleans & stores** every answer plus a singleâ€‘letter version for evaluation.
4. **Evaluates** each model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1. It can optionally print a bar chart of the results.
5. **Exports** both the detailed perâ€‘row results and a metrics table in .tsv format.

## OEG_task script

`OEG_task.py` is **already heavily commented inline**; here what we give is a *birdâ€™sâ€‘eye* companion that walks readers through the key functions that drive them.

This script is designed to:

* Load IMPAQTS-PID.
* Generate model outputs using **three prompting strategies**:

  * **Zero-shot (ZS)**: A simple instruction with no prior examples built in the prompt.
  * **Few-shot (FS)**: 4-shot based prompt dynamically built from `fs_example.txt`.
  * **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Uses a prompt that encourages intermediate reasoning steps, foaded from `CoT_prompt.txt`.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Requirements

Make sure to have Python 3.8+ and install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas torch transformers openai scikit-learn matplotlib
```

For optimal execution time when prompting HF models, install a CUDA-enabled `torch` version.

---

## How to Use

To run both scripts clone this repo and run:

```bash
python MCG_task.py
```

or

```bash
python OEG_task.py
```

After the execution of `MCG_task.py` three new files are created the `results` directory:

* `results/MCQ_results.csv`Â â€” full perâ€‘instance predictions.
* `results/MCG_eval.csv`Â Â Â Â â€” aggregated metrics.
* `results/MCG_eval_plot.png` (optional)Â â€” visual comparison of model scores (useful for presentations!).

After the execution of `OEG_task.py` one new file is created in the `results` directory:

* `results/OEQ_results.csv`Â â€” full perâ€‘instance implicit content explanations.
